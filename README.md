# DOWN Home Assignment

Migrating / deprecating an old data model in a sample Rails app.

> ### A brief explanation of how you will roll out the migration (without downtime) in plain text 
Creating a new table typically has minimal impact on system performance. However, Here are a few strategies to minimize the downtime:
* Run the migration in a staging environment to assess potential performance implications.
* Schedule the migration during off-peak hours if necessary.

> ### Propose strategies for optimizing performance with the new model
To enhance query performance when retrieving picture items for specific users, create an index on the `user_id` column of the `picture_items` table.

> ### Provide your thoughts on how the new model would scale as the application grows in users and data volume. What potential challenges do you foresee, and how would you address them?
* Add pagination to user listing API as the application grows in users.
* Add indexes to frequently queried columns (For example: `user_id` ) to optimize performance.
* Implement caching for frequently accessed data to reduce database load.
